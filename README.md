# Meyloid_DropSEQ_Analysis

# Function

Analyzes Drop_Seq data, implements dimensionality reduction, Sp1 expression analysis This repository is responsible for filtering, normalizing, and transforming DropSEQ data from neural tissue. It generates multiple dimensionality reduced visuializations using PCA, UMAP, and PHATE. It further maps gene expression onto these visuializations. 

# Results

Clear groupings are shown in meyloid vs non meyloid cell types.
